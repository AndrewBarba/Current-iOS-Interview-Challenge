# Current iOS Interview Challenge

Here is a SwiftUI implementation of [Current's](https://current.com) iOS Interview Challenge.

Download the full-challenge requirements [here](http://abarba.me.s3.amazonaws.com/static/current/Readme.pdf).

### Why is this on GitHub?

After spending 3 days building this as an interview submission, they responsed over a week later from a no-reply email address saying they are not conitnuing the interview process. There was no feedback about my submission in the challenge, and no effort from anyone I spoke with to reach out and share feedback.

Given they have no interest in the submission, why not showcase the work.
